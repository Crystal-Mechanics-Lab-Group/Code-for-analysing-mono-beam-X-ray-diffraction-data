# Code-for-analysing-mono-beam-X-ray-diffraction-data

Please follow the below steps for data analysis:

1. Download and unzip the whole folder from github.
2. the unzipped folder should now have 10 zipped folders and matlab codes.
3. Please unzip each folder and extract them in the parent folder where the codes are present.
4. Run the reflections_plot_<samplename> for the concerned sample to generate the results

The raw data being fed into the code is the intensity in the 3d reciprocal space for every measured point along the depth in the sample. The results will include the calcualed shear and direct strains as a function of depth in the sample.
